## Generating Test Images

If you don't have suitable test images, you can:

1. Use stock photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) (check license)

3. Use placeholder image services (not recommended for realistic testing)

**Do not commit real user photos to version control.**

These test images should be synthetic or have proper usage rights.
